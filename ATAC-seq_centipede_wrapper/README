ATAC-seq pipeline:

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The file atac_centipede.sh is a wrapper that starts with a .sam file of aligned
reads and outputs 'footprints' (places in the genome where we predict a TF has
bound). This pipeline does the following to the starting data:

> Filters out low quality reads
> Indexes and sorts reads
> Calls ATAC-seq peaks using macs2
> Uses FIMO to find motifs within those peaks
> Uses Centipede to predict which of these motifs has a TF bound
> Outputs genomic coordinates for predicted footprints
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This wrapper depends on the following, keep all of these updated:

>samtools
>bedtools
>R
>Python
>atactk
>Centipede
>Fimo
>macs2

The following helper scripts / files need to be stored in ~/bin/ATAC_Pipeline:
>split_fimo_by_motif.py
>centipede.R
>ENCODE.hg19.blacklist.bed
